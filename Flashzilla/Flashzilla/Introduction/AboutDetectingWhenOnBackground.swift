    /// There are so many of these that I canâ€™t realistically list them all here, so instead here are two more to try out:
///    UIApplication.significantTimeChangeNotification is called when the user changes their clock or when daylight savings time changes.
///    UIResponder.keyboardDidShowNotification is called when the keyboard is shown.
///    Each of these notifications works in exactly the same way: use onReceive() to catch notifications from the publisher, then take whatever action you want.
